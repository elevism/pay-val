**Objective**
<!-- in a few sentences, describe the key objectives -->



**Background**
<!-- stuff one needs to know to understand this: motivating examples, links to related projects, design docs, etc.; you should mention related work, if applicable; this is background - do not write about ideas to solve problems -->



**Prior Art**
<!-- list of existing solutions, if any, and their corresponding weak/strong points-->



**Detailed Design**
<!-- details on how you'll implement; should be in sufficient detail for other engineers to materially comment on structure to affect the end result; attach diagrams as exhibits numbered from 1 and explain exhibits here -->



**Caveats**
<!-- mention things to watch out for, if any; if necessary, describe what you did/will not do or why simpler approaches don't work -->



**Security Considerations**
<!-- describe the size/shape of the potential attack surface this introduces; describe how you'll limit or remove the surface area; does this involve personally-identifiable information, open network ports, etc.? describe how you will be secure -->



Does this change affect the attack surface in any way?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Performance Considerations**
<!-- is there a change to the payload size? is there a change to the speed data is available to the user or systems (directly or indirectly)? how will you be fast / limit latency? -->



Does this change materially affect performance in any way?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Testing Strategy**
<!-- what is your strategy for testing? what are the potential happy and failure paths? what testing can be automated? what testing must be manual? -->



**Documentation Plan**
<!-- what types of documentation are required: API, User Manual, Dev docs? who needs trained on this? -->



**Public API Surface Impact**
<!-- are you adding new public APIs (public to customer or other applications)? what is the change (methods, routes, packages, config file properties, etc.)? are the new APIs consistent with existing APIs? do they follow naming conventions and correct terminology? -->



Does this change affect the public API?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Developer Experience Impact**
<!-- how will this change impact developer experience and workflows? are we placing new constraints on how devs should write code to be compatible with this change? how will we communicate this? -->



Does this change affect developer experience?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Breaking Changes**
<!-- does this feature create breaking changes, to public APIs, user interface/experience, automated processes, or systems? who will be affected? how can we make it easy to adopt? who must be notified? is there an alternative that remains backwards-compatible? -->



Does this have any breaking changes?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Deprecations**
<!-- can (or should) any existing APIs, tools, or documentation be deprecated as a result of this change? when will the deprecated items be removed? who should be notified and how? -->



Does this change have any deprecations?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Rollout plan**
<!-- does rolling this out affect users or systems? does anything else need to be coordinated with this rollout? how can we maximize adoption? can other parts of the ecosystem take advantage of this, and how will we upgrade them? -->



Does this change have rollout considerations?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
